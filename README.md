# Titanic Data Wrangling & EDA Project
Homework #3: Collaborative Data Wrangling & EDA 
DSE 511 - Fall 2025

## Dataset Information

**Source:** [Titanic dataset from Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/titanic.csv)
**Date Accessed:** September 5, 2025
**Size:** 55.7 kb, 892 rows

## Methods
### Data Cleaning (Cooper)

**Steps taaken to clean the dataset:**

1. Inspected the dataset to determine what varaibles had missing values
2. Since majority of the varaible Deck had missing values I decided to remove the variable
3. Filled the 2 missing values from the variable Embarked with the mode of the values
4. Used random distribution to fill the missing values for age
5. Standarized the variable Sex with 'M' and 'F' values
6. Cleaned and chose the variables useful for analysis

**Variables:**

| Column            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Survived          | Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) |
| Class             | Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) |
| Sex               | Gender (M/F) |
| Age               | Age in years (missing values filled via random imputation + median) |
| SiblingsSpouses   | Number of siblings/spouses aboard |
| ParentsChildren   | Number of parents/children aboard |
| Fare              | Passenger fare |

**Tools/libraries used:** 

numpy was utilized for the random distribution to fill the values in the varible Age

### Exploratory Data Analsis (Amine)
Summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, correlation).
Visualizations (e.g., histogram, scatterplot).
Insights or patterns observed.

## Results
Key findings from EDA (1â€“3 sentences).

Include a representative figure (generated by code, not screenshot).

Optional: brief reflection on what was interesting or unexpected.

## Collaboration Notes
Partner A contributions: [e.g., data cleaning, repo setup]

Partner B contributions: [e.g., EDA, visualization]

Both: [e.g., documentation, merge conflict resolution]

## Reproducibility Instructions
How to run the notebook/script

Dependencies

Special instructions (if any).

## Merge Conflict Reflection
Briefly describe the merge conflict you created and how you resolved it.
